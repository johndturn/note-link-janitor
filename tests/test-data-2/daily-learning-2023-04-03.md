## Notes on Trailhead Maintenance

Notes from things learned while I was completing my trailhead maintenance for all of my [[salesforce|Salesforce]] credentials

- You can now enable Person Accounts in SFDC without contacting Support, as long as the following is true in your org
  - Account object has >= 1 record type
  - User profiles that have read permissions on Accounts also have read permission on Contacts
  - OWD sharing settings or Contact is Controlled by Parent, or both Account/Contact are Private
- [[event-driven-architecture|Event-Driven Architecture]] Updates
  - You can filter which events are delivered based on the Filter Expression that is part of the `PlatformEventChannelMember`
    - Works for [[change-data-capture|Change Data Capture]] events as well as [[platform-events|Platform Events]]
      - _I think this works for CometD and Pub/Sub APIs_
  - On [[cometd|CometD]] subscriptions only, you can also group platform events to push multiple types of events to a single stream / client subscription instead of 1 subscription per event
- [[apex|Apex]] Code Coverage Updates
  - For all 2GP and unlocked packages, you can run a report using the `sfdx` CLI that will show all Apex classes that are low on code coverage
- Updated [[salesforce-oauth-flows|Salesforce OAuth Flow]]: Client Credentials Flow
  - New OAuth flow for server-to-server communication that is a more secure alternative to the Username/Password flow
  - [Documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_client_credentials_flow.htm&type=5)
  - Does not support refresh tokens
  - A much easier-to-implement (also less secure) alternative to the [[salesforce-auth-jwt-bearer-flow|SFDC JWT Bearer Token Flow]]
